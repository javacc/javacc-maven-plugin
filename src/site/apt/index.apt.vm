${project.name}

  This is the Maven 3 Plugin from <<javacc.org>> for processing JavaCC/JJTree/JJDoc v8.1+
   and JTB v1.5+ grammar files.

  The other JavaCC Maven plugins in the wild do not support the full JavaCC <<8>> features
   (architecture and options).

  Since version 3.8.0+, the plugin is no more compatible (i.e. configuration is different)
   with its previous versions (3.0.x).
  
  Note that one can still use the previous versions with JavaCC 8 if he does not need to pass
   options not managed by these versions. But users are encouraged to migrate.
  
  Note also that one can use the MojoHaus Exec Maven plugin to run JavaCC, JJTree, JJDoc or JTB
   as standalone executable, within appropriate phases and directories configurations (but those
   are out of the scope of this documentation).


* Features

  Supports the different JavaCC 8 generators, through dependencies declaration.

  Supports javacc, jjtree, jtb & jjdoc simple goals (executing the corresponding processors).

  Supports the combined jjtree-javacc, jtb-javacc goals (chaining execution of the preprocessor
   and javacc on a grammar file).

  Agnostic of processors options (except of a few ones) (no need to update the plugin when a
   processor changes its options).

  Supports detection of stale / not stale generated files with respect to the grammar file and
   the processors artifacts (jars).

  Supports ignoring errors and failing on last error besides usual failing on first error, for
   plugin configuration, grammar reading and grammar processing errors.


* Goals Overview
  
  The following goals are meant to participate in the <<<default build>>> lifecycle,
   phase <<<generate-sources>>>:
  
  * <<<{{{./javacc-mojo.html}javacc:javacc}}>>>\
    Runs JavaCC on (<<<*.jj>>>) grammar files to generate a parser.
  
  * <<<{{{./jjtree-javacc-mojo.html}javacc:jjtree-javacc}}>>>\
    Runs JJTree then JavaCC in a pipeline to process (<<<*.jjt>>>) grammar files to generate a parser.
  
  * <<<{{{./jjtree-mojo.html}javacc:jjtree}}>>>\
    Runs JJTree on (<<<*.jjt>>>) grammar files to generate annotated (<<<*.jj>>>) grammar files.
  
  * <<<{{{./jtb-javacc-mojo.html}javacc:jtb-javacc}}>>>\
    Runs JTB then JavaCC in a pipeline to process (<<<*.jtb>>>) grammar files to generate a parser.
  
  * <<<{{{./jtb-mojo.html}javacc:jtb}}>>>\
    Runs JTB on (<<<*.jtb>>>) grammar files to generate annotated (<<<*.jj>>>) grammar files.
  
  * <<<{{{./jjdoc-mojo.html}javacc:jjdoc}}>>>\
    Generates BNF documentation from the grammar files.
    
  []
  
  This previous <<<{{{./jjdoc-mojo.html}javacc:jjdoc}}>>> goal is also triggered by the <<<site>>>
   lifecycle, phase <<<site>>>:
  
  * <<<{{{./jjdoc-mojo.html}javacc:jjdoc}}>>>\
    Generates BNF documentation from the grammar files for usage as site reports.

  []
  
  This last goal is for displaying information on the plugin:
  
  * <<<{{{./help-mojo.html}javacc:help}}>>>\
    Displays parameters for all or one goal.
   
* {Usage}
  
  Detailed instructions on how to use the JavaCC plugin (pom configuration, debug mode) can be
   found on the {{{./usage.html}usage}} page.
  
  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, or if you feel like the plugin
   is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{https://github.com/javacc/javacc-maven-plugin/issues}issue tracker}}.
